# Vue.js Shopping Cart System



This is a fully functional shopping cart built using **Vue.js**. The cart system allows users to add, remove, and update products in their shopping cart and calculates the total cost dynamically. The cart is built into a single script file that can be injected into an eCommerce system using Webpack.

## Features

- **Add Products to the Cart**: Users can add products with attributes such as ID, name, price, and quantity.
- **Remove Products from the Cart**: Users can remove individual products or clear the entire cart.
- **Update Product Quantity**: Users can adjust the quantity of items, and changes will be reflected in the total price.
- **Dynamic Price Calculation**: The cart dynamically calculates the total cost based on product quantities, prices, discounts, taxes, and shipping.
- **Customization via Configuration**: Customize the cart system's behavior and appearance using a configuration file.
